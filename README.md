# Parallel Meerkats

> In the Parallel Meerkats project, NFTs are used to represent meerkats in a parallel universe. In this universe, meerkats are intelligent
> creatures that can communicate with each other telepathically. The NFTs can be used by the meerkats to store information about their
> thoughts and experiences.
